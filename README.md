# here4all-online-therapy-platform
Here4All is a web-application designed to help people facing various mental issues such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, etc to connect with therapists online as well as have an access to a variety of mental health blogs. 
The main idea is to provide an alternative to the social taboo and pressure patients feel in attending therapy sessions in person. Also, this provides today's youth a way to deal with rising mental health problems in a positive way. 
Therapists and patients can communicate via chat using the web-app. Therapists can also add various blogs to the site and patients can have an access to all of them.

Since this is a fully equipped web-app with loads of features, i'll explain each of them individually:
